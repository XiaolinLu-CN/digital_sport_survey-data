# Smart Fitness and Health_survey-data

An online survey conducted in 2023 through the Questionnaire Star platform, the largest online survey platform in China. The platform has 10 million daily active users and nearly 300 million monthly users. Since the survey was mainly distributed via WeChat, respondents were WeChat users in China, and quota sampling was used for regional distribution to ensure the sample composition reflected the proportion of internet users in each province. After quality control screening, the effective sample size was 2,101, covering all 31 provinces of China, with respondents aged between 16 and 75.
The authors designed a "Smart Fitness and Health Questionnaire" used in this survey. The questionnaire consists of three modules: (1) the sports participation and smart fitness module, which focuses on respondents' physical exercise participation, smart fitness engagement, and information literacy; (2) the health status module, which assesses respondents' physical health ; (3) the personal information module, which records respondents' demographic, socio-economic, and regional characteristics. The data has been anonymized.
